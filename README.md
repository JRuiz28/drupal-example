# Hi!
First at all, It is important to say that I summarized the code to make it easier to understand.


## Migrations:
I have been to work in migration (Drupal 7 to Drupal 9). This is the last work in manat√≠.
I learn a lot in this work, I also creatde a plugin custom (process and sources). I think I will share that in future in the community drupal.

## Graphql:
I add a folder called `manati_graplql` where it has one example with one node in drupal is display for be use in Nextjs.
I also work in graphql with other nodes, components for landing page, paragraphs and media entity.
As well, I created some nodes in Nextjs, I have a few experience in nextjs.

## Manati_internship:
It is a example how work with hook custom, form custom and event subscriber.
In `.module` you can see about some function like hook insert.
In folder `form` you can see about custom form. For example: buildForm, validateForm and submitForm.
And the last, event subscriber, this is for locked some user when the site need what some form be fill for unlock user. The user can't redirect another request until user fill form.


## Manati_internship:
Notification custom for some user create some specific node. I guided with code core drupal and some website. And some form custom use this notification use Services and dependency injection.

And I have experence with Drupal 7 and integration Frontend-Backend with emultify!

Thanks for your attention! :)
